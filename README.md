⁠Environment Preparation and Versioning 
The foundation of a stable face recognition project begins with a clean environment and the correct Python version. Since your project utilizes NumPy 2.2.6 and Pandas 2.3.3, you must use Python 3.9 or newer to ensure compatibility with these high-version data science libraries. It is strongly recommended to create a dedicated virtual environment by running python -m venv venv and activating it (using venv\Scripts\activate on Windows or source venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux). This step isolates your project dependencies, preventing version conflicts with other software on your system and ensuring that the specific versions of pip and wheel you intend to install don't disrupt your global Python settings.
